This is a repository of courses I have taken to either: evaluate the course as potential new hire training, learn new skills, break bad habbits, experiment, or occupy downtime.

Further README.md files in each folder will contain a link to the course (or site the course is hosted), outline my personal goals before taking the course, and probably include some sort of review at the end.

Each course folder will contain my working files from the course, typically a sketch pad type that might not make sense to others, but is commented to be usefull.

I've made this public on git so that I can share with colleagues and do the courses wherever I find the time.
