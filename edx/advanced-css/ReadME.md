#ED-X Advanced CSS
## Why'd you take this?
I took this course to see if I liked the ED-X training program and style as well as see if there were any new techniques I could pick up that could improve my styling skills.

I knew most of what was covered in this course already, however I like how it was presented. Great refresher, easy to consume.
