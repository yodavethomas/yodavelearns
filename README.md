This is a repository of courses I have taken to either: learn new skills, break bad habbits, expirment, or occupy downtime.

Further README.md files in each folder will contain a link to the course (or site the course is hosted), outline my personal goals before taking the course, and probably include some sort of review at the end.

I've made this public on git so that I can share with colleagues and keep myself honest.
